This led me to Makers Academy, from where I have recently graduated. I am now seeking a junior developer role where I can continue to learn, explore my passions, and contribute in a friendly and positive professional environment.\r\n\r\n### Makers Academy (April - July 2015)\r\n[Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com) is a highly selective 12-week full-time web development course where test-driven development (TDD) and agile working practices are the fundamentals.  Key learning concepts were pair programming, MVP, TDD/BDD, code design principles such as OOP and SOLID, and group project work. In three months I was exposed to full-stack solutions across Ruby and Javascript, basic front-end styling, and a wide range of testing suites.\r\n\r\n### What I Do Really Well\r\n\r\n**Project Planning** - I am well versed in writing user stories and domain mapping to define and design the code I will write - adhering to core design principles (SOLID) and keeping the clients' needs at the heart of the project.  \r\n**Test-driven Development** - The first line of code I ever wrote at Makers Academy was a test and I am a complete advocate for TDD. It drives the emergence of my code and allows it to adapt as my understanding of the task evolves. Thorough unit testing provides clear documentation and efficient debugging.  \r\n**Agile/team skills** - The successful delivery of numerous group projects during my time at Makers Academy provided opportunities to implement Agile best practices, and also hone my communication skills in an ever-changing group dynamic.\r\n\r\n## Recent Projects\r\n\r\nGitHub Repo | Live URL | Project Description\r\n--- | --- | ---\r\n[Treemo](https://github.com/treemoapp) | [treemo-dev.herokuapp.com](http://treemo-dev.herokuapp.com/) | Built a hybrid mobile app using Ionic. It interacts with a custom-built API and also Facebook graph. Features geolocation and google maps plugins and is available as a fully-functional SDK for android.\r\n[Binstagram](https://github.com/timrobertson0122/binstagram) | [binstagram.herokuapp.com](http://binstagram.herokuapp.com) | Instagram clone built on Rails. Features user authentication, Facebook sign in, AWS for image storage, ActiveRecord ORM. Tested with RSpec and Capybara.\r\n[Thermostat](https://github.com/timrobertson0122/thermostat) | [jsthermostat.herokuapp.com](http://jsthermostat.herokuapp.com) | Recreated a simple home thermostat in JQuery/Javascript. Additionally, it queries a public weather API to return a description of the current weather in that city. \r\n[Chitter Challenge](https://github.com/timrobertson0122/chitter-challenge) | [chitter-challenge.herokuapp.com](http://chitter-challenge.herokuapp.com) | Twitter clone - Written in Ruby, served by Sinatra, tested with RSpec and Capybara. Uses DataMapper and Postgresql for DB, Bcrypt for password encryption and email integration via the Mailgun API. Bootstrap for looks.\r\n\r\n## Languages\r\n\r\n#### Ruby\r\n\r\nWhere it all began - I love Ruby for its syntactic sugar, how it often reads practically like English, and the clear and concise documentation. Ruby introduced me to OOP and SOLID design principles, which I strive to apply to my code. I appreciate Rails for the ease of generating an MVP/proof of concept.\r\n\r\n#### JavaScript\r\n\r\nWhat I've seen so far of JavaScript and its vast collection of libraries/frameworks excites me and I am particularly keen to develop my knowledge of how JS can provide a full-stack solution, having dabbled with MEAN.js. I'm comfortable implementing Karma and Protractor for client-side unit and feature testing with Jasmine.\r\n\r\n#### Mobile\r\n\r\nOur two-week final project provided the opportunity to tackle a new technology, and I opted to teach myself how to build a hybrid mobile app using Ionic (Angular) and Cordova. Whilst debugging across multiple platforms proved tricky, I very much enjoyed the experience. Ultimately, I was able to produce an app that was fully functional on my android device, and could be demoed during the project presentation.\r\n\r\n#### Design\r\n\r\nI have an appreciation for good design and try to keep UX in mind during project planning. Having studied the principles of UX/UI design I have some familiarity with Adobe Creative Suite (particularly Photoshop) and mockup/framework tools such as Balsamiq. Previously, I have also produced and edited audio/video for broadcast.\r\n\r\n## LBC (life before code)\r\n\r\n#### Ravensbourne College of Design \r\n\r\n- Foundation BA in Broadcast Production and Technology\r\n\r\n## Experience\r\n\r\n**Sportradar** (Mar 2014 - April 2015)  \r\n   *Analyst*\r\n  - Skilled in conducting detailed data analysis and writing high-quality reports for major international clients such as UEFA\r\n  - Product development work using JIRA\r\n  - Conducted peer training on Microsoft Excel\r\n\r\n**Betfair** (Aug 2006 - May 2013)  \r\n   *Numerous team leader roles across operations, risk, trading, and integrity*\r\n  - Relocated to establish and manage an international team\r\n  - Set and exceeded departmental KPIs for performance and accuracy\r\n  - Use of SQL, Business Objects, VBA\r\n \r\n## Other Study\r\n - Certificate in Information Assurance Awareness\r\n - Digital Analytics Fundamentals (Google)\r\n\r\n## Check Me Out\r\n:octocat: [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/timrobertson0122) | [Twitter Feed](https://twitter.com/robertsonworks)\r\n<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/users/4428270/tim-robertson\">\r\n<img src=\"http://stackoverflow.com/users/flair/4428270.png\" width=\"208\" height=\"58\" alt=\"profile for Tim Robertson at Stack Overflow, Q&amp;A for professional and enthusiast programmers\" title=\"profile for Tim Robertson at Stack Overflow, Q&amp;A for professional and enthusiast programmers\">\r\n</a>\r\n\r\n## Contact Me \r\n:email: [timrobertson@outlook.com](mailto:timrobertson@outlook.com)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
