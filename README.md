## Tim Robertson :shipit:

### tl;dr
```An enthusiastic and committed team player with a passion for leveraging new technologies to improve the world we live in.```

My experience in operational team management at one of the UK's largest online technology companies left me hungry to understand the tech that powered it, and to develop the skills to create my own web apps. This led me to Makers Academy, from where I have recently graduated. I am now seeking a junior developer role where I can continue to learn, explore my passions, and contribute in a friendly and positive professional environment.

### Makers Academy (April - July 2015)
[Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com) is a highly selective 12-week full-time web development course where test-driven development (TDD) and agile working practices are the fundamentals.  Key learning concepts were pair programming, MVP, TDD/BDD, code design principles such as OOP and SOLID, and group project work. In three months I was exposed to full-stack solutions across Ruby and Javascript, basic front-end styling, and a wide range of testing suites.

### What I Do Really Well

**Project Planning** - I am well versed in writing user stories and domain mapping to define and design the code I will write - adhering to core design principles (SOLID) and keeping the clients' needs at the heart of the project.  
**Test-driven Development** - The first line of code I ever wrote at Makers Academy was a test and I am a complete advocate for TDD. It drives the emergence of my code and allows it to adapt as my understanding of the task evolves. Thorough unit testing provides clear documentation and efficient debugging.  
**Agile/team skills** - The successful delivery of numerous group projects during my time at Makers Academy provided opportunities to implement Agile best practices, and also hone my communication skills in an ever-changing group dynamic.

## Languages

#### Ruby

Where it all began - I love Ruby for its syntactic sugar, how it often reads practically like English, and the clear and concise documentation. Ruby introduced me to OOP and SOLID design principles, which I strive to apply to my code. I appreciate Rails for the ease of generating an MVP/proof of concept.

#### JavaScript

What I've seen so far of JavaScript and its vast collection of libraries/frameworks excites me and I am particularly keen to develop my knowledge of how JS can provide a full-stack solution, having dabbled with MEAN.js. I'm comfortable implementing Karma and Protractor for client-side unit and feature testing with Jasmine.

#### Mobile

Our two-week final project provided the opportunity to tackle a new technology, and I opted to teach myself how to build a hybrid mobile app using Ionic (Angular) and Cordova. Whilst debugging across multiple platforms proved tricky, I very much enjoyed the experience. Ultimately, I was able to produce an app that was fully functional on my android device, and could be demoed during the project presentation.

#### Design

I have an appreciation for good design and try to keep UX in mind during project planning. Having studied the principles of UX/UI design I have some familiarity with Adobe Creative Suite (particularly Photoshop) and mockup/framework tools such as Balsamiq. Previously, I have also produced and edited audio/video for broadcast.
